Wireframes are quick, lightweight outlines design specs that layout a web page.
Being able to discuss and plan your core elements allows your web page to have
a solid foundation to build on. This is an important skill when you work on
web design and development.

In this exercise, you will be identifying and discussing semantic HTML syntax
from an example wireframe.

Which parts in the wireframe should the following HTML tags be assigned to?

- Main Heading (h1) : at the top right below nav bar.
- Subheading (h2): any heading before the paragraphs.
- Main Image (img); theres one in the center of the wireframe
- Text paragraphs (p): any chunk of text starting with lorem ipsum with exception of large fonts as heading
- Links (underlined blue text) (a): where all the blue links are, as well as the nav links and footer links.
- Lists (ul, ol, li): links are currently in lists.
- Sections (div): header, body, footer. Inside those youll find divs for anchor links, div for paragraphs, etc.
- Social media icons (identify what tag a social media icon is): facebook and twitter icon on share article.

Are there any other HTML tags that should be assigned to a part in the
wireframe?

# Design Notes

## What I like about Github website design:

The site has a memorable logo. it's the sillouete of a cat. To me it represents the behind the scenes, unseen creators/force that build something. They are usually not client-facing, so it's very reflective of software developers and the type of job they have.

The site is black and white, very minimal, has a technical feel, like you are in a coding sheet. so very on brand with been a control version platform for code.

I like the search bar tells you a quick command to type in search without clicking. that makes it website more useful.

I would say is long lasting per Dieter's Ram because most things in it are highly relevant, and they don't post unnecessary content nor they create responsiveness for everything, just down to the basics.

they use sans-serif font: clean, minimal. short formatted.

## What don't I like about Github website design:

I think it can be hard to navigate. There is a lot of text with very little guidance of where to click or what the text represents. Is it a menu, a nav bar, a side bar?

I don't like I can't tell what's clickable or not unless I am exactly on the spot with my cursor.

in their header, they have lots of icons that are not intuitively recognizable.
